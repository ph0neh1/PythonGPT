## Important
I have not tested this script due to not being able to obtain an OpenAI API key so test at your own risk, feedback will be appreciated so I can improve the script overtime as I cannot debug past the part where it generates the response!
I have only tested this script on Python 3.11, you may encounter errors on other versions.
